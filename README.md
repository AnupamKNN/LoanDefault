## üè¢ About the Company

**NeoFinance** is a leading fintech company founded in 2015, specializing in **personal**, **home**, and **business loans** for individuals and SMEs. With over **2 million customers** across India, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East, the company uses a **digital-first approach** to approve loans within minutes.

However, rising loan defaults have prompted the company to explore **AI-powered risk assessment models** to improve its underwriting process and reduce financial risk.

---

## üìâ Problem Statement

NeoFinance currently relies on traditional credit scoring systems like **CIBIL** and **Experian**, which overlook vital behavioral and social factors such as:

- Income fluctuations  
- Spending patterns  
- Social & behavioral data  

This outdated approach results in:
üö© **Approval of high-risk applicants**  
üö© **Rejection of potentially good customers**  

To mitigate this, NeoFinance aims to develop an **AI-powered Loan Default Prediction System** that:

‚úÖ Identifies high-risk applicants before loan approval  
‚úÖ Predicts default probability using behavioral and financial features  
‚úÖ Optimizes interest rates and approval criteria based on risk profiling  

---

## üíº Business Perspective

### üîπ Why Does NeoFinance Need This?

NeoFinance's current system leads to:

- üí∏ Financial losses due to defaults  
- ‚ùå Missed opportunities from rejecting low-risk applicants  

### ‚úÖ Benefits of AI Integration

- üìâ **Reduce default rates** with accurate risk profiling  
- üìà **Increase revenue** by approving more reliable applicants  
- ‚ö° **Accelerate loan approvals** through real-time ML inference  
- üí° **Enhance decision-making** for the finance and risk teams
