    "\n",
    "NeoFinance serves over 2 million customers across India, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East, using a digital-first approach to approve loans in minutes. However, an increasing number of loan defaults has led the company to explore AI-powered risk assessment models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <B> Problem Statement </B>\n",
    "\n",
    "NeoFinance has seen a rise in loan defaults over the past two years due to economic instability and changing borrower behavior. Currently, their approval system relies on traditional credit scores (CIBIL, Experian, etc.), which fail to capture important factors like:\n",

    "- Spending patterns\n",
    "- Social & behavioral data\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, NeoFinance approves loans for high-risk customers, leading to financial losses. The company wants an AI-powered Loan Default Prediction System that:\n",
    "âœ… Identifies high-risk applicants before loan approval\n",
    "âœ… Predicts default probability based on applicant behavior\n",
    "âœ… Helps the finance team optimize interest rates & approval criteria\n",
